In this repository you will find the original unity project for the application, so an assessor could look into the code. The project has been developed in Unity 2022.1.4f1. The project has been shared as a zipped file instead of a unity package because of the size of the project. Extract the zip file and import it by using the unity hub. Here is a link of a forum post explaining how to do it. https://answers.unity.com/questions/189296/how-to-import-project.html
