# Myco
In this repository you will find the original unity project for the application, so an assessor could look into the code. The project has been developed in Unity 2022.1.4f1 using .net5 C#. The project has been shared as a unity package because of the size of the project. The unity package is relatively big, so have patience when importing it to an empty project, on an average laptop it will take 5 minutes to open everything. Here is a tutorial of how to import packages in unity: https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/AssetPackages.html
And here is how to download unity if not done already:

Some parts of the code are commented, however not everything. The code was meant for prototype purposes and was not meant as a full product, even though the functions work accordingly. 
The apk file of the app is also included in the repository, the app works for android phones only from Android 5.0 and upwards. The functions of the app do only work if a MYCO is connected, this version is an exploratory version, to only see the how the code is put together. 
Arduino code of the myco is also included, again, not everything is commented but most of it should be clear. Again, the code has been for prototype purposes and demonstration purposes. It is not ready for publishment. 
A link to the json file of the database is also provided.

Myco.zip is the apk file
Myco_esp32 is the arduino code
Myco package is the package file for the .net5 C# code in unity
