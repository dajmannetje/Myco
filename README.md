# Myco
In this repository you will find the original unity project for the application, so an assessor could look into the code. The project has been developed in Unity 2022.1.4f1 using .net5 C#. The project has been shared as a zipped file instead of a unity package because of the size of the project. Extract the zip file and import it by using the unity hub. Here is a link of a forum post explaining how to do it. https://answers.unity.com/questions/189296/how-to-import-project.html

Some parts of the code are commented, however not everything. The code was meant for prototype purposes and was not meant as a full product, even though the functions work accordingly. 
The apk file of the app is also included in the repository, the app works for android phones only from Android 5.0 and upwards. The functions of the app do only work if a MYCO is connected, this version is an exploratory version, to only see the how the code is put together. 
Arduino code of the myco is also included, again, not everything is commented but most of it should be clear. Again, the code has been for prototype purposes and demonstration purposes. It is not ready for publishment. 
A link to the json file of the database is also provided.
